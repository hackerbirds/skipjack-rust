# skipjack-rust
A silly implementation of the Skipjack block cipher in Rust. For details of the implementation, see this document: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/documents/skipjack/skipjack.pdf

## Why?

For fun of course.

## How to run

A `cargo run` in `src/` should do it.
